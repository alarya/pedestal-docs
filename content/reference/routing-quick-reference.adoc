== Library

The library link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route[`pedestal.route`]
provides the core components to express routes and construct
routers. It can be used independently of the pedestal-service library.

== Route Specifications vs. Routers vs. Routing Interceptor

Routing is the process of recognizing an incoming request, and matching it to a particular behavior.
A route identifies a particular request path and request method (such as :get or :post) and identifies
corresponding behavior in terms of a handler function, or a list of interceptors to execute.

"Route specifications" are the data values that spell out the possible routes.

"Routers" are built from route specifications, and apply a specific strategy to match incoming requests
to the provided routes; there are a few different built-in Router implementations, with different limitations
and other trade-offs.

The routing interceptor builds on a router to dispatch incoming requests to routes
defined by the route specification. It identifies the route matching the incoming request
and queues up route-specific interceptors to handle the request.

Generally, all of this is automatic; an application provides a route specification in the :io.pedestal.http/route key
of the link:service-map[service map] (and perhaps a value for :io.pedestal.http/router) and a routing
interceptor is automatically created.

== Route Specifications

Route specifications go through a series of transformations that results in a routing table;
a routing table is a sequence of verbose routing maps.

The
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
function converts any kind of specification into a routing table:

|===
| Argument to `expand-routes` | Syntax used

| Vector
| Terse - improvement on Verbose format with an emphasis on avoid redundancy

| Set
| Table - most recent and straight forward; trades some redundancy for simplicity

| Map
| Verbose - oldest format
|===

This mapping from type to specification type is the responsibility of the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-ExpandableRoutes[ExpandableRoutes] protocol, which is
extended on Map, Set, and Vector.

To support a new syntax, come up with a syntax that resolves to new record type that implements the
`ExpandableRoutes` protocol.

=== Routing Table

The expanded routing table is a list of maps, with the following structure:

[source,clojure]
----
  {:route-name :org.example.app/new-user
   :app-name   :example-app        ; optional
   :path       "/user/:id/*blah"   ; like Ruby on Rails
                                   ; (catch-all route is "/*path")
   :method     :post               ; or :any, :get, :put, ...
   :scheme     :https              ; optional
   :host       "example.com"       ; optional
   :port       "8080"              ; optional
   :interceptors [...]             ; vector of interceptors to be enqueued on the context

   ;; Generated for path-matching:
   :path-re           #"/\Quser\E/([^/]+)/(.+)"
   :path-parts        ["user" :id :blah]
   :path-params       [:id :blah]
   :path-constraints  {:id "([^/]+)"
                       :blah "(.+)"}
   :query-constraints {:name #".+"
                       :search #"[0-9]+"}
   }
----

`:route-name` must be unique; typically it is a qualified keyword to ensure uniqueness.

The keys `:path-re`, `:path-parts`, `:path-params`, and
`:path-constraints` are derived from the `:path`.  This is part of what the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[expand-routes] function is responsible for.

Users will not generally write routes directly in verbose format.

=== Table Syntax

Table syntax was introduced in release 0.5.0.

Table syntax is expanded by
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
into the full (verbose) syntax shown above.

When the argument to `expand-routes` is a *set*, it will be expanded using the table syntax.

In table syntax, each route is a vector of:

1. Path string
2. Verb. One of `:any`, `:get`, `:put`, `:post`, `:delete`, `:patch`, `:options`, or `:head`
3. A single handler, or a vector of interceptors
4. Optional route name clause
5. Optional constraint clause

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
  ["/user/:id/*blah"  :post  [...] :route-name :new-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
----

The `:host`, `:port`, `:app-name`, and `:scheme` are provided in a map that applies to all routes in the list.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
(route/expand-routes
  #{{:host "example.com" :scheme :https}
    ["/user/:id/*blah"  :post  [...] :route-name :new-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})
----

When multiple routes use the same path, they must differ by both verb and route name.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
(route/expand-routes
  #{["/user/:id"  :post `new-user  ; <1>
     :route-name :new-user  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
    ["/user/:id"  :get  `view-user
     :route-name :view-user :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})
----
<1> Note the use of a backtick; this ensures that the `new-user` symbol is expanded to a namespace qualified symbol,
not the value of `new-user`.  This namespace qualified symbol will be used to derive the route name as a namespace qualified
keyword, and the actual interceptor or handler will be the resolved value of the symbol.  In many cases, it makes sense
to wrap the entire route specification (here, the outer set) with a back-tick.

Every route must have a unique name, but it may be possible to omit it.

A default route name will come from the `:name` of the last interceptor in the chain.

Alternately, if a handler function is provided, or the last interceptor is a qualified symbol
to a function, the route name will be derived from the function.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
    ;; Route names will be taken from the symbols
    (defn new-user [request] ,,,)
    (defn view-user [request] ,,,)

    (route/expand-routes
      #{["/user/:id"  :post [,,, `new-user]  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
        ["/user/:id"  :get  [,,, `view-user] :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})

    ;; Route names will be taken from the interceptors
    (def new-user-intc {:name ::new-user :enter (fn [context] ,,,)})
    (def view-user-intc {:name ::view-user :enter (fn [context] ,,,)})

    (route/expand-routes
      #{["/user/:id"  :post [,,, `new-user-intc]  :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]
        ["/user/:id"  :get  [,,, `view-user-intc] :constraints {:id #"[0-9]+"}]})
----

=== Terse Syntax

The terse syntax is designed to remove a fair amount of repetition in the table syntax;
it exploits the structure of the request path to allow for multiple routes at the same
path (but with different HTTP methods), and nested paths.  This pattern is very common
when building a REST-style interface.

Terse syntax is expanded by
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
into the full (verbose) syntax shown above.

When the argument to `expand-routes` is a *vector*, it will be expanded using the terse syntax.

In the terse format, a route table is a vector of nested vectors. Each
top-level vector describes an "application". The application vector
contains the following elements:

- (Optional) A keyword identifying the application by name
- (Optional) A URL scheme
- (Optional) A host name
- (Optional) A port
- One or more nested vectors specifying routes

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
;; Application vector with one route vector (which has one route)
[[:hello-world :http "example.com" 8080
 ["/hello-world" {:get `hello-world}]]]
----

Route vectors can be nested arbitrarily deep. Each vector adds a path
segment. The nesting structure of the route vectors maps to the
hierarchical tree structure of the routes.

Each route vector contains the following:

1. A path segment. This must begin with a slash.
2. A verb map
3. (Optional) An interceptor vector with `^:interceptors` metadata
4. (Optional) A constraints map with `^:constraints` metadata
5. Zero or more child route vectors

The interceptors and constraints specified above apply to the current
route and any child route vectors. Interceptors and constraints can be
defined before the verb map as well.

The allowed keys in a verb map are:

- :get
- :put
- :post
- :delete
- :any

The value of each key is one of:

* A namespace qualified symbol for a handler function
* An interceptor
* A vector containing (in the following order):
** A keyword representing the unique route name
** An optional interceptor vector with `^:interceptors` metadata
** An interceptor or namespace qualified symbol for a handler function

Each verb in the verb map defines a route on the path. This example
defines four routes.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/order" {:get `list-orders
            :post `create-order}
   ["/:id" {:get `view-order
            :put `update-order}]]]]
----

Interceptors and constraints apply to every route in the verb map. In
this example `load-order-from-db` and the numeric constraint `:id`
apply to both the `:get` and `:put` routes for the path "/order/:id".

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http
    ["/order" {:get  `list-orders
               :post `create-order}
     ["/:id"
      ^:interceptors [`load-order-from-db]
      ^:constraints  {:id #"[0-9]+"}
      {:get `view-order
       :put `update-order}]]]]
----

(Recall that metadata is attached to the _next_ data structure
read. The metadata `{:interceptors true}` will be attached to the interceptors vector.
The metadata `{:constaints true}` will be attached to the constraints map. Refer to the link:https://clojure.org/reference/metadata[Metadata] documentation to learn more about metadata.)

If multiple routes have the same handler, you will need to distinguish
them by providing route names. (This is necessary so URL generation
knows which route to use.) A route name is a keyword that goes in the
first position of an interceptor vector in the verb map. In the
following example, both POST routes have the same handler. We provide
the keywords `:post-without-id` and `:post-by-id` to distinguish the
routes.

[source,clojure]
.example.clj
----
[[:hello-world :http "example.com"
 ["/order" {:get  `list-orders
            :post [:post-without-id `create-order]}
   ["/:id" {:get  `query-order
            :post [:post-by-id `create-order]}]]]
----

== Routers

Pedestal includes several Routers; this reflects not only the evolution of the Pedestal library,
but also allows for different trade-offs in the algorithm used by each Router.  In rare cases, an application
can provide its own Router rather than use one of Pedestal's.

When your application starts a Pedestal service with
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-servlet[`create-servlet`] or
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`create-server`],
Pedestal creates a router, using the following keys from the service map:

|===
| Key | Meaning

| `:io.pedestal.http/routes` | A route specification
| `:io.pedestal.http/router` | Key to select a router, or a function that constructs a router from a routing table
|===

When the value of `:io.pedestal.http/router` is a keyword, it selects
one of the built-in algorithms:

- `:map-tree`
- `:prefix-tree`
- `:linear-search`

include::router-table.adoc[]

=== Custom Router

When the value of `:io.pedestal.http/router` is a function, that
function is used to construct a router. The function must take one
argument: the routing table. The constructor must a value that satisfies the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html#var-Router[`Router`]
protocol.

So the function is passed the routing table and returns a `Router` for those routes.
The `Router` is supplied with the incoming request, and returns the matching route map
(a verbose route map extended with extracted parameters from the path).

=== Routing Interceptor

The function link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-router[router] is where it all comes together;
this function is passed the route specification and, optionally, the router type; from that it creates
the routing table, and passes that through the correct constructor, obtaining at the end an interceptor
that performs routing, which it returns.


During request execution, on a successful routing, the following keys are added or updated in the context map:

|===
| Key / Key Path | Value

| :route | The verbose route map

| :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/queue | route-specific interceptors are queued

| [:request :path-parameters] | Path parameters extracted from the request path

|===

On failure, when the router does not match any route, the context key `:route` is set to nil.
