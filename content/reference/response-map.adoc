== Description

The response map is attached to the link:context-map[Context Map] by any
interceptor in the interceptor chain. The response map describes the outgoing
HTTP response. If no response map is attached to the context by the time
processing is done or the attached response map is not valid footnoteref:[1, Response validity has different semantics depending on the Pedestal layer in question. Pedestal's core HTTP processing layer only requires the `:status` key for a response to be considered valid. This is the semantic used by the default `not-found` interceptor. Meanwhile, Pedestal's lower-level servlet-specific termination check abides by the Ring response specification, requiring  `:status` and `:headers` keys with valid values.], Pedestal generates a 404 response.

|===
| Key | Always Present? | Type | Description
| `:status`
| Y
| integer
| The HTTP status code

| `:headers`
| N
| map of String -> String
| Response headers sent to the client. Header names are all converted to lower case.

| `:body`
| N
| String, ISeq, File, InputStream
| The body of the response sent to the client.
|===


Note that code that returns a header should use the proper case version of the header, for example,
`Content-Type` (not `content-type`); although incoming link:request-map[request headers] are converted
to lower case, outgoing response headers are left as-is, and some standard interceptors expects
certain headers to be present with the correct name (such as `Content-Type`).
